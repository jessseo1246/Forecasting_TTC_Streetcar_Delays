Exploring the Influence of Weather on TTC Streetcar Delays and Forecasting Delays


Many people rely on public transportation as their only source of travel. When public transit experiences unexpected delays or cancellations, it disrupts many passengers' schedules and raises safety concerns. With the city expecting the population to grow, how are they preparing to accommodate more passengers when current issues remain unresolved?

This project analysis Toronto's streetcar delays and their causes, along with weather conditions, to identify delay patterns. The goal is to provide accurate information to commuters about upcoming streetcar delays.


Data Resources: 

The datasets used in this project were collected from the City of Toronto's Open Data platform and Environment Canada. Weather data was scraped from multiple URL links with the necessary permissions. After gathering these two separate datasets, they were merged to commence the analysis. The resulting dataset consists of 32,251 rows and 21 columns.
