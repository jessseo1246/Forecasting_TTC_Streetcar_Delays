  <h1> Exploring the Influence of Weather on TTC Streetcar Delays and Forecasting Delays </h1>
</div>

### ðŸš‚Project Objectives:


Many people rely on public transportation as their only source of travel. When public transit experiences unexpected delays or cancellations, it disrupts many passengers' schedules and raises safety concerns. With the city expecting the population to grow, how are they preparing to accommodate more passengers when current issues remain unresolved?

This project analyzes Toronto's streetcar delays and their causes, as well as the influence of weather conditions, to identify delay patterns. The goal is to provide commuters with accurate information about upcoming streetcar delays.

### ðŸš‚Data Resources:

The datasets used in this project are collected from the City of Toronto's Open Data platform and Environment Canada. Weather data is scraped from multiple URL links with the necessary permissions. After gathering these two separate datasets, they are merged to commence the analysis. The resulting dataset consists of 42,265 rows and 15 columns.

[Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ldtAjMVd1zzPN4EjZbrB1EyqPUVLt3ue?usp=sharing): 
- TTC dataset: 2021 Jan.01 - 2023. Sept.30
- Weather dataset: 2021 Jan.01 - 2023 Sept.30
