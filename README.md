Exploring the Influence of Weather on TTC Streetcar Delays and Forecasting Delays

Using machine learning, how might we predict TTC streetcar delays in real-time such that we can provide safe and efficient experience for all passengers?

Many people rely on public transportation as their only source of travel. When public transit experiences unexpected delays or cancellations, it disrupts many passengers' schedules and raises safety concerns. With the city expecting the population to grow, how are they preparing to accommodate more passengers when current issues remain unresolved?

This project analyzed Toronto's streetcar delays and their causes, along with weather conditions, to identify delay patterns. The goal is to provide accurate information to commuters about upcoming streetcar delays.

Data Resources: 

The datasets used in this project was collected from City of Toronto's Open Data and Environment Canada. The weather data had to be scraped from multiple url links and it permitted to be used. After collecting two individual datasets, it is merged to start the analysis! The dataset is created with 32251 rows and 21 columns.
